## Predicting Credit Risk
Using supervised machine learning to create models that predict whether a loan from LendingClub will be high risk or not

Data from 2019 was used to train a Linear Regression and Random Forest model to predict the credit risk of loans from the first quarter of 2020. Categorical data was converted to numeric and it was ensured that all categories were present in both sets of data. Linear Regression and Random Forest Models were run on both unscaled and scaled data and efficacy of both model types on the data was compared.
